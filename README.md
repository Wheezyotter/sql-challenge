# sql-challenge
sql-challenge is an exercise to practice creating database schema and queries using SQL. 

To practice these skills, a database was constructed based on six CSV files created by Mockaroo, LLCLinks to an external site., (2022). Realistic Data Generator. 

An Entity Relationship Diagram was created using QuickDBD.com to model the database relationships and can be found as "Entity Relationship Diagram.png". table_creation.sql creates six tables to house the six CSV files on employee information. data_queries.sql sets up eight queries on employee information.
